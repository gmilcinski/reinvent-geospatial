### AWS Public Datasets: Learnings from Staging Petabytes of Data for Analysis in AWS

[Video]() | [Slides]()

AWS hosts a variety of public data sets that anyone can access for free. Previously, large datasets such as satellite imagery or genomic data have required hours or days to locate, download, customize, and analyze. When data is made publicly available on AWS, anyone can analyze any volume of data without needing to download or store it themselves. The AWS Open Data Team will share tips and tricks, patterns and anti-patterns and tools to help you most effectively stage your data for analysis in the cloud.

### Global Open Transportation Projects

[Video]() | [Slides]()

The need for public and private entities to collaborate and exchange data about transportation-related issues is becoming more and more prominent. This session will feature The World Bank describing DRIVER, a web and mobile application enabling field data collection and analysis of road safety incidents, currently being tested and piloted in several countries, primarily in Asia. Also featured is SharedStreets, a non-profit developing a global data infrastructure for streets, and creating new models for third-party data exchange.

### Using AWS and Open Data to Meet the Demands of Disaster Response Situations

[Video]() | [Slides]()

The cloud can enable groups to support humanitarian and disaster response partners through all phases of the response cycle. We'll hear from the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team about how they are using AWS along with open-source tools to deploy a fully scalable system that can meet the needs of emergency activations and crisis response situations. We'll also take a look at a prototype for monitoring and starting a response chain based on the USGS Earthquake Notification Service.

### AWS Disaster Response: Using Deployable Native AWS Services for your Rapid Response Infrastructure

[Video]() | [Slides]()

During and after a disaster, the speed, timeliness, and accuracy of response and recovery efforts can be the difference that saves many lives. In this session, you will be introduced to the Amazon Web Services Disaster Response Program (AWS DRP). We will provide an overview of the program, its purpose, services, and the capabilities designed to assist customers responding to disasters and/or emergencies. This session will also provide insights into “the Art of the Possible” as it relates to how the various native AWS Services can be used to deliver the capabilities required to assist customers in accessing critical data, infrastructure, and decision making tools during disasters.

### Transitioning Geoscience Research to the Cloud: Opportunities and Challenges

[Video]() | [Slides]()

NASA, Alaska Satellite Facility and the University of Washington are all going through the process of empowering groups of internal and external users to work with planetary scale datasets. This session will look at the various techniques used to power those internal revolutions and lower the cost of knowledge for all.
